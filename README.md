# Signature-Fraudulent-Detection-using-SIFT-and-ORB
The project helps us to detect and classify the Signatures based on its authenticity. This project uses CNN to classify the signatures based on the owner of the signature, and then uses ORB and SIFT image matching algorithms to detect whether the signature is fraudulent or original
